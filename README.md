A minimal Phoenix app starting point

The priceples of this project is create a starting point to embrace JS again, embrace CSS again and to not delagate everything to Liveview.
This will be useful when investigating 3rd party JS frameworks and or any other frameworks I want to try and incorparate with Elixir/Phoenix.
The point of this project is not to be a starting point for your sass but rather a clean starting point for trying ideas or frameworks with little setup.

### Out of the box

NO:

- Ecto
- Tailwind
- CoreComponents.ex
- LiveView

Added:

- Basic Channel
- Postcss + Nested Css plugin + AutoPrefixer
- Simple CSS with darkmode
- ESM JS modules
- Esbuild config

Roadmap:

- Dockerize
- Auth

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
